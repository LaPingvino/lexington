INT. OFFICE - DAY

JOHN sits at his desk, typing on a computer. The phone RINGS.

                    JOHN
          Hello, this is John.

                    VOICE (V.O.)
          We have a problem.

John stops typing and sits up straight.

                    JOHN
          What kind of problem?

                    VOICE (V.O.)
          The kind that requires immediate
          attention.

John grabs his coat and heads for the door.

                    JOHN
          I'm on my way.

EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

John exits the building and gets into his car.

                    JOHN
                    (to himself)
          Here we go again.

He starts the engine and drives away.

FADE OUT.
