INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Two friends, ALICE and BOB, sit across from each other at a small table.

ALICE
I can't believe you're moving to New York.

BOB
It's a great opportunity. I have to take it.

ALICE
But what about our friendship?

BOB ^
We'll stay in touch.

ALICE ^
It won't be the same.

Beat.

ALICE
(emotional)
I'm going to miss you so much.

BOB
(reaching across the table)
Hey, this isn't goodbye forever.

ALICE
Promise me you'll call every week.

BOB ^
I promise.

ALICE ^
(smiling through tears)
Okay. I guess I'm happy for you.

They reach across the table and hold hands.

FADE OUT.
