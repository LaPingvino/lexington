FADE IN:

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A busy street corner coffee shop with outdoor seating. People walk by carrying briefcases and coffee cups.

SARAH (25), wearing a blue dress and carrying a laptop bag, approaches the entrance.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - CONTINUOUS

The coffee shop buzzes with activity. BARISTA (20s) works behind the counter.

SARAH walks to the counter and looks up at the menu board.

                    SARAH
          I'll have a large coffee with cream,
          please.

                    BARISTA
                    (smiling)
          Coming right up. Will that be for
          here or to go?

                    SARAH
          For here, thanks.

Sarah pays and moves to wait for her order. She notices MIKE (30), sitting alone at a corner table, typing on his laptop.

                    BARISTA (O.S.)
          Large coffee with cream!

Sarah retrieves her coffee and hesitates for a moment, then approaches Mike's table.

                    SARAH
          Excuse me, is this seat taken?

Mike looks up from his laptop.

                    MIKE
          Oh, no, please sit down.

Sarah sits across from him and opens her laptop.

                    SARAH
          Thanks. I'm Sarah, by the way.

                    MIKE
          Mike. Nice to meet you.

They both return to their work, occasionally glancing at each other.

BACK TO SCENE

                    SARAH
          Would you like to grab dinner
          sometime?

                    MIKE
                    (surprised but pleased)
          I'd like that very much.

                         CUT TO:
