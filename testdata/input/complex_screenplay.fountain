# ACT I

## Chapter 1: The Beginning

INT. SPACESHIP BRIDGE - NIGHT

The bridge is dimly lit by blinking control panels. CAPTAIN SARA WELLS (40s), a no-nonsense leader with graying temples, stares out at the star field.

LIEUTENANT TORRES (20s) approaches from behind.

                    LIEUTENANT TORRES
          Captain, we're receiving a distress
          signal from the Epsilon sector.

                    CAPTAIN WELLS
                    (turning around)
          How far out are we?

                    LIEUTENANT TORRES
          Approximately six hours at maximum
          warp.

Wells considers this for a moment.

                    CAPTAIN WELLS
          Set course for Epsilon sector.
          Maximum warp.

= The ship changes course toward danger

                    LIEUTENANT TORRES
          Aye, Captain.

TORRES moves to his station and begins inputting commands.

                    CAPTAIN WELLS ^
          And Lieutenant...

                    LIEUTENANT TORRES ^
          Yes, Captain?

The dual dialogue continues as both characters speak simultaneously.

                    CAPTAIN WELLS ^
          Prepare the away team.

                    LIEUTENANT TORRES ^
          Already on it, sir.

Wells nods approvingly.

!FORCED ACTION: The ship lurches suddenly as it enters warp.

~WELLS sings under her breath
          "Space, the final frontier..."

@COMPUTER VOICE
          Warning: Approaching Epsilon sector.

                    CAPTAIN WELLS
                    (to Torres)
          On screen.

The main viewscreen flickers to life, revealing a damaged space station.

                    LIEUTENANT TORRES
          Captain, I'm reading massive hull
          breaches. Life support is failing.

                    CAPTAIN WELLS
          How many survivors?

                    LIEUTENANT TORRES
                    (checking readings)
          Sensors show approximately fifty
          life signs... but they're fading
          fast.

Wells moves closer to the screen.

                    CAPTAIN WELLS
          We need to move quickly. Assemble
          rescue teams Alpha and Beta.

She pauses, then turns to Torres.

                    CAPTAIN WELLS (CONT'D)
          And Torres? Make sure they're
          equipped for zero-G operations.

                    LIEUTENANT TORRES
          Understood, Captain.

Torres heads for the exit.

                    CAPTAIN WELLS
                    (calling after him)
          And Lieutenant! Be careful out
          there.

> FADE TO BLACK. <

                         CUT TO:

INT. DAMAGED SPACE STATION - CONTINUOUS

Emergency lighting casts eerie red shadows. SURVIVOR 1 (30s) and SURVIVOR 2 (40s) huddle together near a damaged control panel.

                    SURVIVOR 1
                    (whispering)
          Do you hear that?

                    SURVIVOR 2
          Hear what?

A faint humming sound grows louder.

                    SURVIVOR 1
          That humming... it's getting closer.

Suddenly, the lights flicker and go out completely.

                    SURVIVOR 2
                    (in darkness)
          Sarah? SARAH?!

The humming stops abruptly.

                    SURVIVOR 1 (O.S.)
          I'm here... but something's wrong.

A bright light suddenly illuminates the scene as rescue teams beam in.

                    RESCUE TEAM LEADER
          We're here to help! How many
          survivors are there?

                    SURVIVOR 2
                    (relieved)
          Thank God! There are about fifty
          of us scattered throughout the
          station.

                    RESCUE TEAM LEADER
          We need to move fast. This station
          won't hold together much longer.

The rescue operation begins.

MONTAGE - THE RESCUE OPERATION

A) Rescue teams sweep through damaged corridors
B) Survivors are beamed to safety one by one
C) The station continues to deteriorate
D) Time is running out

BACK TO SCENE

                    RESCUE TEAM LEADER
                    (into communicator)
          Captain, we've found all the
          survivors, but there's something
          else...

INTERCUT - PHONE CONVERSATION

                    CAPTAIN WELLS
                    (on bridge)
          What is it, Commander?

                    RESCUE TEAM LEADER
                    (on station)
          We've discovered what caused the
          damage. It wasn't an accident.

Wells' expression hardens.

                    CAPTAIN WELLS
          Sabotage?

                    RESCUE TEAM LEADER
          Worse. We're dealing with something
          that's not... human.

The line goes silent for a moment.

                    CAPTAIN WELLS
          Get everyone out of there. Now.

                    RESCUE TEAM LEADER
          Already in progress, Captain.

END INTERCUT

The last of the survivors dematerialize as they're beamed to safety.

                    RESCUE TEAM LEADER
                    (to his team)
          That's everyone. Let's go!

The rescue team prepares to beam out when a strange SOUND echoes through the station.

                    TEAM MEMBER
          What was that?

                    RESCUE TEAM LEADER
          Nothing good. Energize!

They beam out just as something moves in the shadows behind them.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. SPACESHIP - SPACE

The rescue ship moves away from the damaged station at full speed.

INT. SPACESHIP SICKBAY - LATER

DR. CHEN (50s) examines one of the survivors.

                    DR. CHEN
                    (to nurse)
          These readings are... unusual.

                    NURSE
          Unusual how, Doctor?

                    DR. CHEN
          The cellular damage patterns don't
          match any known energy weapon.

She pauses, studying her tricorder.

                    DR. CHEN (CONT'D)
          It's almost as if something was...
          feeding on them.

The nurse looks disturbed by this revelation.

                    NURSE
          Feeding?

                    DR. CHEN
          I need to speak with the Captain
          immediately.

                         MATCH CUT TO:

INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Wells sits behind her desk as Dr. Chen enters.

                    DR. CHEN
          Captain, we have a problem.

                    CAPTAIN WELLS
          The survivors?

                    DR. CHEN
          They're stable for now, but their
          injuries suggest they encountered
          something... not of this world.

Wells leans forward.

                    CAPTAIN WELLS
          Explain.

                    DR. CHEN
          The energy patterns are unlike
          anything in our database. Whatever
          attacked that station, it's still
          out there.

A long pause as Wells considers this information.

                    CAPTAIN WELLS
          Double our security patrols and
          put the ship on yellow alert.

                    DR. CHEN
          Captain, there's something else.

                    CAPTAIN WELLS
          Yes?

                    DR. CHEN
          I don't think we rescued everyone.

Wells stands up sharply.

                    CAPTAIN WELLS
          What do you mean?

                    DR. CHEN
          I mean I think something came back
          with us.

The lights suddenly flicker and dim.

                    CAPTAIN WELLS
                    (hitting comm button)
          Red alert! All hands to battle
          stations!

Alarms begin blaring throughout the ship.

                         SMASH CUT TO:

# ACT II

## Chapter 2: The Hunt Begins

INT. SPACESHIP CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Crew members run through the corridors as red alert lights flash.

                    CREWMAN 1
                    (running)
          What's the emergency?

                    CREWMAN 2
                    (also running)
          Unknown! Just get to your station!

They disappear around a corner as the lights flicker again.

A shadow moves across the wall - something that shouldn't be there.

                                               FADE OUT.
